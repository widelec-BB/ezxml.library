ezxml.library
=============

Port of ezXML for MorphOS as shared library.

ezXML is a C library for parsing XML documents inspired by simpleXML for PHP.
As the name implies, it's easy to use. It's ideal for parsing XML configuration
files or REST web service responses. It's also fast and lightweight.

ezXML was written by Aaron Voisine <aaron@voisine.org> and is distributed under
the terms of the MIT license as described in LICENSE.

MorphOS adaptation was created by Filip "widelec" Maryja≈Ñski and is also
distributed under the terms of the MIT license as described in LICENSE.

Original version is available at https://github.com/lxfontes/ezxml
and http://ezxml.sourceforge.net/.

MorphOS adaptiation uses some code from libvstring library which Grzegorz
Kraszewski made available on BSD license.
